        Overview

        There are three questions, the last one 
        1 and 3 are based on the same project wo
        manipulation. Question 2 is a written ex
        located at the end of this practical out

        Solution.* subdirectories.

        Practical Outline

        1. Open the UseFile project and look at 
        file.hpp header file. The aim of this pr
        defined in file.hpp to copy one file to 
        number of member functions that can be u
        stream to a file, and read and write dat
        to include the "file.hpp" header file. 

        Declare two file objects, one for the so
        target, and open one for reading on the 
        for writing on the file target.txt. Set 
        the source file and write it to the targ

        Don't forget to check for the end of fil
        you have completed the copy. 

        Build and test your program. Compare the
        source.txt file to confirm that the copy

        2. Given the following spec, write out a

        * A class is needed to represent the con
        * Bank accounts are associated with an a
        * Amounts may have amounts withdrawn and
        * It is possible to set an overdraft on 
        * It should be possible to query the acc
          them directly.
        * It must be possible to initialise a ba
          that the opening balance is 0 and that

        Hints:

        * Assume the existence of a class money 
        * Which member functions should be const

        Optional

        3. Using the UseFile project. Modify mai
        in the output file by 8 spaces. Also tru
        output file to 48 columns. You may wish 
        or the appendix on string.

        2. The following class definition satisf

        class bank_account
        {
        public:
            void set_up(
                const string &name,
                const string &number);
            string name() const;
            string number() const;
            void  withdraw(const money &);
            void  deposit(const money &);
            money balance() const;
            void  overdraft(const money &);
            money overdraft() const;
        private:
            string holder, id;
            money  current, limit;
        };
