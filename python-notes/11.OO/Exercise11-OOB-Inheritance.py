# CHAPTER:    Object Oriented Programming
# OBJECTIVE:  Complete the following questions. 
# PROBLEM:    Use inheritance to calculate the area of different shapes.
# TIME:       15m


# Q. define a class called Shape
# ... Give the class Shape one method, area.
# ... the area method should have no implementation
# HINT: pass


# Q. Define a Rectangle which extends from Shape.
# Rectangle should have an __init__ method 
# which assigns a width and height.

# Q. define a class Square which extends from Rectangle
# ... add an area method to square which
# ... returns the area of the particular square instance.
# HINT: formula for area is  width * height

# print the area of various squares.
# HINT: create several square instances and call .area() on these


# EXTRA:
# Q. is there something wrong with the definition of Square?

# Q. add a constructor to square that calls Rectangle's constructor 
# ... call it so no misshapen squares can be made..
