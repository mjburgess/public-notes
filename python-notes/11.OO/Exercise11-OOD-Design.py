Write a small application which describes...

Registering delegates as they enter a classroom.

Questions:
    What single objects are there?                
            -- Classes with single(scalar) properties

        What properties do these objects have?    
            -- __init__ properties

    What changes to these objects are there?      
        -- Methods

    What groups of objects are there?             
        -- Classes with listy (aggregate) properties

"""

# EXTRA
"""
Q. look around the room:
    What things are there? 
        For each type of thing create a class.

    What do they *do*?
        For each thing they do add a method to the class?

    What do they *have*?
        For each kind of data they have, 
            add a property to their constructor 

        (ie., in the __init__ add a self.something = )


Do this for 4 or 5 very different kinds of object.
