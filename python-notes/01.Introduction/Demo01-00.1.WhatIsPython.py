# WHAT IS PYTHON?

""" NOVICE ASIDE:

Why do we use programming languages?

Languages are *for* programmers. Programmers are humans, humans have an innate and powerful capacity of langauge.
Language easily describes problems. 

"""

# Python is a scripting language
print("Hello")
print("World")  # commands are interpreted line-by-line

# Python has latent, dynamic typing
# (types are not written in the code + types are belong to values)
print('Sherlock' + 'Holmes')

# Python is object oriented 
print('Sherlock'.__add__('Holmes'))

# all values are objects which you ask-to-perform operations 

# Python is free, open source and portable
