# CHAPTER:    Flow Control
# OBJECTIVE:  Complete the following questions. 
# PROBLEM:    Using if/elif/else display which pub was chosen.
# TIME:       10 m


import random
option = random.choice(['PubA', 'PubB', 'PubC', 'PubD'])

# Q. if the option is 'PubA' print 'Chose A', 
# and so on for B, C, D ...
# HINT: use the repl to find out what random.choice does

# Q. request a password, if the password is not correct_password, 
# print INCORRECT PASSWORD
# HINT: input
correct_password = 'TEST'


# EXTRA 

# Q. can you rephrase your answer to the first question as a dictionary?
# HINT: knowing the option, you need a string to print 


# rather than print INCORRECT PASSWORD above, call sys.exit()
# HINT: you will need to import sys
