/*
 *  INTRODUCTION TO EXERCISES 
 * 
 * In each exercise you will be asked to write and run some code. 
 * This can usually be done in one of two ways:
 * 
 * 
 * 1. Using the C# interactive window in Visual Studio 
 * 
 * 2. Using any editor (eg. notepad++) write your solution line-by-line and
 *    run with csi from the developer tools prompt.
 *     
 * 3. Create a visual studio project, writing the solution in the Main()
 *    method of the Program. 
 *
 *  IF YOU USE VISUAL STUDIO, PRESS CTRL+F5 TO RUN THESE PROGRAMS
 *      this keeps the commandline window open so you can see your results. 
 *      
 * You should keep your own set of solutions separate from these notes 
 * so that you can refer back to them.
 * 
 * For example, for every new exercise create a new project in visual studio.
 *  (Right-click on csharp-notes, Add -> New Project)
 *  
 *  You can run each Project independently by selecting it 
 *      next to the green play arrow. 
 *      
 * Solutions to every exercise are provided, 
 * however it is better to try the exercise first 
 * and then ask for help if you are stuck. 
 * 
 * NB. The solutions use Solution() rather than Main() 
 *     as each chapter is its own project with one Main() defined in Program.cs
 *     .

/*
	1. Procedural Programming

	a. state
	Q. Define some variables which descript your:
	    name, age, job, favourite colour, etc.

	b. behaviour

	c. state change
	Q. Perform some operations on these variables:
	    Increment your age by 1
	    Add the string "'s Profile" to your name and write it to the terminal. 

	d. identity & equality
