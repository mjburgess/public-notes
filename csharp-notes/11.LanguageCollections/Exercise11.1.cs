//In the main method of your program:

/*
ARRAYS
    Q. Define an array of strings where each element is a country name.
    Q. Define an array of longs where each element is that country's population.
    Q. Define an array of strings europe, which includes some european countries.

    Q. iterate over your countries array printing out the name AND the population
        HINT:  *for* loop, not foreach

*/



/*
LISTS

	Q. Convert your countries array into a List<string>.
	    HINT: pass countries into the List constructor

	Q. Loop over your european array and .Add()  each element your countries list.

	Q. Remove the initial two elements of your countries list. 
	    HINT: .RemoveRange(0, 2)
	 
    Q. Print out every element of your resulting list
*/



/*
DICTIONARIES
    Q. Create an empty dictionary, populations which maps from strings to longs. 

     Add the appropriate elements from your initial arrays. 
 
     HINT:  dict[countryName] = population

    Q. Define a function which performs the same operation as the above.

     HINT:
         Dictionary<string, long> MapPopulation(string[] , long[])

    Q. Use this function to print out the names and populations in one foreach loop.

/*
SETS
    Q. Print the unquie elements of countries.

    HINT: pass your countries array into HashSet's constructor & loop
