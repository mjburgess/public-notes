/*
 * 
 * Create a C# Library (.dll). Use this Library in a C# Program
 * 
 * C# Program prints areas of shapes.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 
 * # STARTER
 * 
 * Q. Create a .cs file containing a class defintion named Math (no Main()!) 
 * 
 * Q. This class should contain a public int Area(int square)
 *      that returns the area of a square.
 *       *      
 * Q. Compile this to a .dll file.
 * 
 * Q. Create a .cs file containing a typical program class defintion 
 *  (ie., with a Main())
 * 
 * Q. In your main method create a Math object 
 * 
 * Q. WriteLine the area of a 10-sided square using your Math object
 * 
 * Q. Compile this program with csc, including a reference to your .dll
 *
 * 
 * # ADVANCED
 * 
 * Math Library,  
 * Provides a class called OneDimensionalShape with methods: 
 *  AreaOfSquare, AreaOfCircle 
 *      and a double field "Length"
 * 
 * Q. Create a .cs file containing a class defintion (no Main()!) 
 * 
 * Q. This class should contain a constructor accepting a Length 
 *  and two methods AreaOfSquare and AreaOfCircle . 
 * 
 * HINT: the formula are:
 *  length * length  for square 
 *  3.1416 * length * length for circle
 * 
 * Q. Compile this to a .dll file.
 * 
 * Q. Create a .cs file containing a typical program class defintion 
 *  (ie., with a Main())
 * 
 * Q. In your main method create a OneDimensionalShape with a length of 10
 * 
 * Q. WriteLine the square area and the circle area.
 * 
 * Q. Compile this program with csc, including a reference to your .dll
