# CHAPTER:    String Handling
# OBJECTIVE:  Complete the following questions. 
# PROBLEM:    Using string methods, analyse and display some quotes.
# TIME:       20 m

fictional_quote  = "What's this? What's this? I have possibly gone daffy? What's this?"
fictional_author = "- Jack Skellington"

political_quote = "History will be kind to me for I intend to write it."
political_author = "- Winston Churchill"

unknown_quote  = "  "
unknown_author = "  "

quotables = "

    Albert,Einstein
    William,Shakespeare
"

author = {
    name: 'Oscar Wilde',
    era: 'Victorian',

}

# Q. print out the author name, era and type

# Q. display the longest quote

# Q. print 30 dashes
#... then the fictional_author and fictional_quote,
#... then 30 dashes

# Q. define authors by splitting apart quotables

# Q. print each on their own line
# HINT: puts

# Q. if fictional_author ends with 'Skellington'
#... print the fictional_quote and the first name of the author

# Q. if the unknown_author is empty or just whitespace,
#... print 'Unknown Quote'
# HINT: strip

# HINT: .sub


# Q. use the range below
#... and  .chr to print the letters A to Z on one line
letters = 65..(65 + 26)

# Q. now define letters using a character range and print again
