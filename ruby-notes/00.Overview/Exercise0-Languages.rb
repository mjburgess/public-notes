# CHAPTER:    Overview
# OBJECTIVE:  Complete the following questions. 
# TIME:       


# Part 1 – Compiler, Computer, Programming Language

# In a group assign at least: 

# one person the role of "Computer" 
# one person the role of "Compiler" 
# one person the role of "Programmer"

# Each role can be filled by multiple people.

# The computer can only receive instructions written numerically, and only give numeric output. 
# For example the computer might receive the instruction "10 20 30" and write down the output "40 50 60". 

# The compiler receives instructions in very precise English and converts them into numbers for the computer. 
# For example, the compiler may receive the instructions "stand-up, move 1m left, sit down" 
# and output the numbers, "10 20 30"

# The compiler should reject imprecise instructions. 
# The programmer writes very precise instructions for the compiler.

# HAND IN:
# PLEASE HAND-IN THREE PIECES OF PAPER:
# The instruction set, the program in english, the program in numbers 

# TASK 1
# The first task of your group is to determine what instructions the computer will follow. 
# The computer might move around ("stand up", "sit down")
# if there’s more than one they may talking to each other or swapping items ("computer-1 swap pen with computer-2").
# Computers define what abilities they have (moving, adding up, swapping pens, etc.).

# TASK 2
# The second task of your group is to come up with translations from English to numbers that the computer will accept
# For example "stand up" might be translated to "10" so that whenever the computer sees "10" they stand up. 
# The compiler will work with the computer to define what each number will mean. 

# The final task of your group is to write a program. 
# The program should consist of precise statements, written in English, that gets handed to the compiler 
# then the computer and the output of the computer (if any) will finally be handed back to the programmer. 

# The programmers will write the computer program.
