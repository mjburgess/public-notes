# ABOUT THE NOTES
These are my personal notes to assit in teaching. 

The material, which is freely accessible in this DRAFT form, is divided into demonstrations, exercises and their solutions â€” missing is the significant amount of tailored discussion that occurs as I teach, which is developed in response to the skills, backgrounds and needs of those I am teaching. 

These a free for your own personal use: to improve, cite, note and refer to. 

For any other use, please contact me.
